# Titanic-survival-data

### Overview
On April 15, 1912, the passenger liner Titanic  collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage as the world's largest and fastest ship.More than 1500 passengers and crew died, making this one of the deadliest  sinkings of a single passenger ship to date.

This project will comprise two parts, namely:

(i) exploratory data analysis 

(ii) building a machine learning model to predict the survival status of a passenger based on features such as class of travel and gender

### Dataset 

The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica.This data does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers, as well as other information such as class of travel and gender. 

The dataset used for this project is from the Seaborn online repository which had already undergone a small amount of pre-processing. 

### Findings
(i) Women and first class passengers had a higher chance of survival 

(ii) Out of the three models tested, the multilayer perceptron had the highest F1 and AUC-ROC scores
